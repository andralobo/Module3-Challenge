# Election Audit
## Overview of Election Audit
### Purpose
The Election Commission has requested an audit on the recent election.  They have requested to include the voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county and the county with the highest turnout. A breakdown by candidate was also requested to include votes per candidate and the percentage of the total votes.

The polling data was provided in a csv file to be reviewed and through this analysis we will be able to show the new results to satisfy the Election Commission.

## Election Audit Summary
The script used for this analysis can be used for future election audits and would only need minor modifications.  It currently can run through any number of candidates and counties an a csv file.  The code can easily be updated use another file name by updating the path and file name shown below.

The current script pulls in the csv file and uses column 2 which is the county and column 3 from the csv but can be modified if the columns do not match.  See below where the value in the square brackets can be easily updated to pull from different columns from the csv file.
